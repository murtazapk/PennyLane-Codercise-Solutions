## 📌 About the Repository

The purpose of this repository is to document solved codercises from the PennyLane Codebook while building strong foundations in:

- Quantum circuit construction  
- Parameterized quantum gates  
- Entanglement  
- Quantum measurements  
- Optimization techniques  
- Variational quantum algorithms  

All implementations are written in **Python** using the **PennyLane** library.
